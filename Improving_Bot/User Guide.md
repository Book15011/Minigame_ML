## Improving Bot – User Guide

This section is used to train a better bot by creating a new bot from the Q-table using reinforcement learning with an epsilon-greedy approach.

### How to Train a Better Bot

1. Open the `Improving_Bot` folder.
2. Run `project1_Teach.c` to refine an existing bot’s Q-table.
3. If you want to change the teacher bot, modify `project1_Teach.c` inside the `int main()` function.
4. Adjust the number of training episodes as needed for improved performance.

This process iteratively enhances the bot’s decision-making ability, leading to a stronger AI.
